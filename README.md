# Watershed_Analysis_using_Python

AIM : To calculated Watershed Delineation Using Python

Abstract:

The watershed delineation is defined as the area of land which servesunder catchment of river or stream. Using watershed delineation we calculate stream order, flow directions, catchment area and basins.Watershed delineation is carried out using Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Digital Elevation Models (DEM) is grids of cell which contain information regarding the elevation in each cell. DEMs store same kind of information as contour lines do, but with different data structure. For many years engineers have been using paper maps for watershed delineation. But recently watershed delineation is carried out using software such as QGIS, ArcGIS, etc. but it seems to be too tedious and requires extensive training to use such software, hence we have developed an alternate method for doing such kind of analysis using Python script which can be implemented in any system using Bash Script. In this project we have developed a python algorithm to calculate flow direction, strahler order and catchment area using PCRaster module at a desired location. PcRaster is an open source module used for various spatio-temporal analysis with support of GDAL. It is also user friendly python module for watershed analysis. The result shows that this is most convenient and cheap method for watershed analysis. It also provides efficient and robust results.

Watershed Analysis:

As a result of tremendously increasing population, the pressure on
natural and upland resources has increased exponentially. Hence,
watershed degradation has become a worldwide issue.
Recognizing the importance of conversation of upland area and natural
resources, especially in the developing countries where agriculture is
the pre â€“ dominant form of occupation. Watershed management has
received utmost importance from the countries itself.
Watershed Analysis involves extracting river or stream network,
flowdirections, catchment area or basins through manual or digital
means.
In simple words watershed is a region of land within which water flows
down into a specified body, such as a river, lake, sea, or ocean i.e. to
a drainage basin. The word watershed is sometimes used
interchangeably with drainage basin or catchment.
Traditionally engineers used to do watershed delineation using manual
survey/maps. But recently various new software are developed such as
QGIS, ArcGIS, GRASS, etc. for watershed analysis.
Remote sensing and Geographic information systems (GIS) uses
GeoTIFF and other formats to organize and store the gridded, or raster
datasets which are useful for watershed analysis.
